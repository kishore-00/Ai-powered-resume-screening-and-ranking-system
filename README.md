# Ai-powered-resume-screening-and-ranking-system
The manual screening of resumes is a time-consuming and often biased process, leading to inefficiencies in recruitment. This project aimed to develop an AI-powered resume screening and ranking system to automate this task, improving efficiency and reducing human bias. The primary objectives were to design and implement a system that could automatically extract key information from resumes, match candidates to job requirements, and rank them based on suitability.
The methodology involved utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, the system employed techniques like named entity recognition and semantic similarity analysis to parse resumes and extract relevant skills and experience. A machine learning model, trained on a dataset of resumes and job descriptions, was used to evaluate candidate suitability and generate a ranked list.
Key results demonstrated a significant improvement in screening efficiency and accuracy. The system successfully automated the initial screening process, reducing the time required to review resumes. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy and precision, indicated a strong correlation between the system's ranking and human assessments. Furthermore, the system minimized the potential for human bias in the candidate selection process.
In conclusion, this project successfully developed and implemented an AI-powered resume screening and ranking system. The system's ability to automate resume analysis and provide accurate rankings offers a valuable solution to the challenges of traditional recruitment. The results suggest that such systems can significantly enhance hiring efficiency and objectivity, ultimately contributing to a more effective and equitable recruitment process.
